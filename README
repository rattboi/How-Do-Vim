How Do Vim?
2012 Thomas Schreiber


This project is a couple of files I use in a one hour vim workshop for
computer science students who are new to console editors. I have given
the workshop about six times and a very large majority of the students
continue to use vim afterwards.

If there is interest I may release a screencast of the workshop.

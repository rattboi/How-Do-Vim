So, you think you are a vim pro? See how many of these challenges you can get
through by the end of the workshop.

All problems should be accomplished without plugins inside of vim.

1.  Sort the following list:

    orange
    bannanna
    grape
    apple
    pear
    kiwi

2.  Use a macro to enumerate this list:
   
    one
    two
    three
    four
    five

3.  You are now in Python. Write a macro that will comment out the current line:
   
    print hello
   
4.  Map 'jk' to <ESC> in insert mode.

5.  Turn on relative line numbers.

6.  Copy a piece of code off of the net, and paste it into vim in Paste mode.

7.  Change the color of the status bar.

8.  Perform Rot-13 on the following line.

    Frperg 

9.  Write a macro that reverses the current line.
